# CLAUDE.md — i10s

**i10s** — LLM instruction docs (numeronym for *instructions*), in two kinds: **human-facing methodology** (read by people) and **llm-context payloads** (consumed by the model). Includes the distribution mechanism — a consuming repo names files in `llm.conf`, a git event syncs them into the vendor dirs it detects.

**Open source, licensed, public.** Higher exposure than any sibling repo: the content *is* the product, and it is read by strangers by design.

## This repo is public-bound — keep it clean

Everything here is written to be read by strangers. **Design docs and change logs describe the engineering, not the circumstances around it.**

Never write into this repo:

- **Personal or colleague names**, or anything identifying an individual.
- **Employer, client or project references** from paid work — including implicit ones (what a client's sector is, when a contract ends, who a manager is).
- **Career, hiring or commercial framing** — why a project helps a job search, who it's meant to impress, IP or contract reasoning.
- **First-person notes about the author** or their background.
- **Strategy, sequencing or roadmap material.** This repo records *what* and *why technically* — never *why now*.

**Change logs are the highest-risk surface.** They're written in the moment, when private-repo assumptions still hold, and never re-read. Apply the same rule to them as to the prose above them.

If a rationale is genuinely about circumstance rather than engineering, the entry here should simply omit it — not gesture at it.
